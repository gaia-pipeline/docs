### Introduction

The RFCs located here define the mechanics of Gaia in great detail in order to reach
consensus by all the participants.

### How does it work?

The RFCs located here are first introduced as Issues under the Gaia repository located here:
<a href="https://github.com/gaia-pipeline/gaia" target="_blank">Gaia on Github</a>

Then, a PR is opened up in the documentation section of Gaia thus enabling an interactive
discussion about the RFC. It is done thus so changes and edits aren't lost or could be easily
reverted allowing for an organic grow of an RFC.

### First RFC

For an example, please take a look at the first RFC defining the Distributed execution model
located here: <a href="https://github.com/gaia-pipeline/gaia/issues/107" target="_blank">RFC: Distributer Pipeline execution via Workers</a>
