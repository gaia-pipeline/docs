## Contribution

Gaia can only evolve and become a great product with the help of contributors. If you like to contribute, please have a look at our <a href="https://github.com/gaia-pipeline/gaia/issues" target="_blank">issues section</a>. We do our best to mark issues for new contributors with the label `good first issue`.

If you think you found a good first issue, please consider this list as a short guide:

* If the issue is clear and you have no questions, please leave a short comment that you start working on this. The issue will be usually blocked for two weeks to solve it.
* If something is not clear or you are unsure what to do, please leave a comment so we can add further discription.
* Make sure that your development environment is configured and setup. You need Go installed on your machine and also nodeJS for the frontend. Clone this repository and run the make command inside the cloned folder. This will start the backend. To start the frontend you have to open a new terminal window and go into the frontend folder. There you run npm install and then npm run dev. This should automatically open a new browser window.
* Before you start your work, you should fork this repository and push changes to your fork. Afterwards, send a merge request back to upstream.
