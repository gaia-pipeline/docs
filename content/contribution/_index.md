## Contribution

Gaia can only evolve and become a great product with the help of contributors. If you like to contribute, please have a look at our <a href="https://github.com/gaia-pipeline/gaia/issues" target="_blank">issues section</a>. We do our best to mark issues for new contributors with the label `good first issue`.

If you think you found a good first issue, please consider this list as a short guide:

* If the issue is clear and you have no questions, please leave a short comment that you start working on this. The issue will be usually blocked for two weeks to solve it.
* If something is not clear or you are unsure what to do, please leave a comment so we can add further description.
* Make sure that your development environment is configured and setup. You need Go (1.10+) installed on your machine and also nodeJS for the frontend. Clone this repository and run the `make` command inside the cloned folder. This will start the backend. To start the frontend you have to open a new terminal window and go into the frontend folder. There you run `npm install` and then `npm run dev`. This should automatically open a new browser window.
* Before you start your work, you should fork this repository and push changes to your fork. Afterwards, send a merge request back to upstream.
